## Task 01
You have an odd array (array with odd numbers). [ 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 ]. Now convert this array into an even array (array with even numbers). [ 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 ]. Do this using for loop & `array.map()` method. Hints: add one to any odd number and it will become an even number.
## Task 02 
You are given an array say : [33,50,79,78,90,101,30]. Now return/get all the elements which are divisible by 10 using `array.filter()` Method.

### Now Do the same task of question 2. But do this using `array.find()` Method. Then compare the output of question 2 and question 3
## Task 03 
You have an array of objects
``
const instructor = [
    {name : 'Nodi' , age : 28 , position : 'Junior'},
    {name : 'Akil' , age : 26 , position : 'Junior'},
    {name : 'Shobuj' , age : 30 , position : 'Senior'},
]
``
### Your Task is to display the instructor name that has the position senior using filter.

## Task 04 [Using reduce()]
`
const people = [
    {name : 'Meena' , age : 20},
    {name : 'Rina' , age : 15},
    {name : 'Suchorita' , age : 22},
]
`
1) Follow above array of objects. So you have 3 objects as array element. Can you find the total sum from here?
<b>20+15+22=57</b> (Output will be <b>57</b>)
What are you thinking ? Do it with for...loop. I know you can do it.
But wait! wait! wait!! Do same things using `array.reduce()` method.
